I'm a mechanical engineer with expertise in control systems, nonlinear vibration analysis, and deep learning. I'm passionate about developing intelligent systems that can solve real-world problems. I have experience in implementing various deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for predictive maintenance and fault diagnosis.
