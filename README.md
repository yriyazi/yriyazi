### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**yriyazi/yriyazi** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on system identification of duffing oscillator
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning supervised Deep Learning
I'm a mechanical engineer with expertise in control systems, nonlinear vibration analysis, and deep learning. I'm passionate about developing intelligent systems that can solve real-world problems. I have experience in implementing various deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for predictive maintenance and fault diagnosis. When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.


Here are some ideas to get you started:
